Why do programming languages succeed and fail? It's not just because they're good or bad. If the opinions of programmers determined success and all was good in the world, we would all be writing Rust and Lisp instead of Python and Java. So what does it take? Programming languages that succeed build the world of software. This clearly matters but is little examined, so let's dive in.
### Well-designed
Of course, being a well-designed language still matters for overall success, but it is far from the determining factor. History contains countless beautiful also-beens and hideous successes (no need to name them). No matter how sound the type system, how expressive the syntax, how perfect the paradigm, nothing is guaranteed in this field. But success is not random! There are many more factors at work.
### Riding hype
Java, Rust
Some languages ride waves of hype on their way to glory, taking advantage of fickle memetics and marketing. 
### Killer framework
Ruby, Elixir
### Platform blessed
Swift/Objective-C, JS
### Free and available
C/C++, Java, everything
### Third-party ecosystem
Python
### Corporate backing
Java, Go
### IDE friendly
C#, Java, Typescript
