I've been having a lot of fun today working on the banner for this blog.  My creation is a visualisation of elementary cellular automata, with each column being a state that wraps around, and the next state being to the right of the previous one.  If you click on it, you should be able to see some controls for changing various parameters, most interesting being the rule.

Checkout out [Wolfram's page](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html) for more details about their operation.  I feel especially confident pointing there because Stephen Wolfram was the original discoverer and namer of elementary cellular automata.
